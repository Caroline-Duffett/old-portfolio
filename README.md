To start this project I made a new repo on Github with my SSH key. Then I made five directories, one for each tab (home, bio, resume, projects, links). Each directory has an html with its own css and js file linked to it. The next thing I did was create a header with each page of the website linked to it. Once the header was working and I could jump from page to page I started putting the information in each webpage. Inside my css and js pages I included links to where I got information on how to do certain things. I also put a "    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">" in each html header to help me with my media queries. Once the text was in I would style the page with css or js and adjusted the media queries as needed. I will go into more detail on each page below.

Home page:
  This is where I styled the header and figured out the colors and shadows I wanted for it and the rest of the website. I used box-shadow and font-shadow on this page. I also made the header and footer have a linear-gradient background. The body's background is also an image that I figured out how to display. I researched about the Date method in js so I could display the date under my 'Welcome' text. These were all techniques and methods I have never used before.

Bio page:
  For this page I used a few flexboxes to help me style it. I included a photo carousel, which I figured out how to make from my class notes. I also put a profile picture of me in this page. I did not want my unordered lists to have typical bullet points. I researched how to but icons in place of the circles and learned how to animate them. I changed the border radius on most elements in this page to give it a rounded look. I used an inset box shadow to make the elements stand out more. There are three media queries for this page.

Resume page:
  Jquery was used to make and style this page. I know traditional javascript and css would have been better to use, but I wanted to practice jquery. I used a function with an if else statement to make a media query, I researched how to do this. Functions were also needed to make the header's tabs become bold when you hover over them, I researched how to do this as well. I included an image of a resume template as my resume. If you click the "view resume" button, the image will slide down slowly. I also researched on how to put in a window.alert with jquery for when you clicked on the image(resume).
