# portfolio
This is my portfolio. I created it for a class project.

Explanations of the technologies used: I used JavaScript and jQuery.

The approach taken:
  To start this project, I made a new repo on Github with my SSH key. Then I made five html files and linked each with their own css and js files. The next thing I did was create a header with each page of the website linked to it. Once the header was working and I could jump from page to page, I started putting the information in each webpage. Inside my css and js pages I included links to where I got information on how to do certain things. I also put a "<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">" in each html header to help me with my media queries. I used Google Fonts to get different fonts in my webpages. Once the text was in, I would style the page with css or js and adjusted the media queries as needed. I will go into more detail on each page below.

  Home page:
    This is where I styled the header and figured out how I wanted the colors and shadows to look. I used box-shadow and font-shadow on this page. I also made the header and footer have a linear-gradient background. The body's background is also an image, which I figured out how to display. I researched about the Date method in js so I could display the date under my 'Welcome' text. These were all techniques and methods I have never used before.

  Bio page:
    For this page I used a few flexboxes to help me style it. I included a photo carousel, which I figured out how to make from my class notes. I also put a profile picture of me in this page. I did not want my unordered lists to have typical bullet points. I researched how to put icons in place of the circles and learned how to animate them. I changed the border radius on most elements in this page to give it a rounded look. I used an inset box shadow to make the elements stand out more. There are three media queries for this page.

  Resume page:
    JQuery was used to make and style this page. I know traditional JavaScript and css would have been better to use, but I wanted to practice jQuery. I used a function with an if else statement to make a media query, I researched how to do this. Functions were also needed to make the header's tabs become bold when you hover over them, I researched how to do this as well. I included an image of a resume template as my resume. If you click the "view resume" button, the image will slide down slowly. I also researched on how to put in a window.alert with jQuery for when you clicked on the image(resume).

  Projects page:
    I used a flexbox to display project divs. Each div will have the same randomized background color. I looked at our quilt class notes to help me accomplish this. There is also a modal on this page that will display when it loads and if a project link is clicked on and there is nothing there yet. I also looked at our class notes to remember how to do this. There are four media queries for this page. I also created a very basic game of tic tac toe to go in the project 1 section. For the tic tac toe game, I used JavaScript to make it run. There are two name inputs, one for player one and another for player two. Once a start button is clicked a game board will appear. It will alternate between player one and player two. I could not figure out how to stop the game when someone wins or if there are no more spaces left. The players will have to judge this on their own until I can figure that part out.

  Links page:
    For this page I made a scrollable flexbox. The links to my profiles are photos. I also figured out how to embed a livestream YouTube video inside the flexbox as well. This was easier than I expected. I right clicked on the YouTube video and copied and clicked "copy embed code". This gave me the <iframe> tag.

Unsolved problems:
  Getting the tic-tac-toe game to end when there is a winner or if the board is full. Right now, the user just has to determine when someone has won or if there can be no more moves. I could not figure out how to get the resume to stay viewable once the button was clicked and the screen changed media queries. If you change window size past the media queries you will have to re-click the "view resume" button. If I used JavaScript for the resume page I probably would not have faced this issue, but I wanted the jQuery practice.
